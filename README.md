This repository contains some basic examples on how to implement OrbitDB in Javascript using various methods and frameworks.

## Usage

Different frameworks and implementations are provided. Below are installation and usage details for each example.

To start, check out this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb-examples.git
```

### Nodejs

Bundle OrbitDB in a node application.

The Node.js demo provides an example of how OrbitDB uses IPFS to replicate records across peers.

Install the 3rd party NPM packages and run the example:

```bash
cd ./nodejs
npm i
```

Run two terminal windows, terminal 1 and terminal 2.

In terminal 1, run the following:

```bash
node index.js
```

Once running, an OrbitDB address will be printed in the form /orbitdb/<hash>. Copy this before moving on to the next step.

In terminal 2, run index.js, passing the OrbitDB address you copied from the other window:

```bash
node index.js /orbitdb/<hash>
```

You should see the second peer add a record which the first peer should also print to the screen.

To close the peers and exit the two instances of the daemon, press ctrl+c in each of the terminal windows.

### Browser

Run OrbitDB as a simple web app.

Launch a local web server. For example, you can use the [Python's HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):

```
cd ./browser
python3 -m http.server 8081
```

Browse to http://localhost:8081/

### Browser ES

Run OrbitDB as a simple web app for ES compatible browsers (e.g. <script type="module"/>).

Launch a local web server. For example, you can use the [Python's HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):

```
cd ./browser-es
python3 -m http.server 8081
```

Browse to http://localhost:8081/

### Webpack

Integrate OrbitDB with a webpacked app.

Install the 3rd party NPM packages:

```
cd ./webpack
npm i
npm run build
```

Launch a local web server. For example, you can use the [Python's HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):

```
python3 -m http.server 8081
```

Browse to http://localhost:8081/

### React

Install the 3rd party NPM packages and run:

```
cd ./react
npm i
npm run start
```

Browse to the specified localhost URL in your web browser.

### Vue + Vite

Integrate OrbitDB in a VueJS app.

Install the 3rd party NPM packages and run:
